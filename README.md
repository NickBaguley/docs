# Gigstartups

Gig Startups are the concept of having a different type of company corporate structure, that is focused on creating an outward mindset, rewards value creation, and does so through quantum attribution to work efforts.

This is a community developed open-source structure.  The structure is available for use under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE), unless otherwise specified.
